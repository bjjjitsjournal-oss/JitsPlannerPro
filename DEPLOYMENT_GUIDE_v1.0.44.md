If you have Android Studio installed on your Windows machine:

1. **Pull latest code from Git**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Navigate to android folder**:
   ```bash
   cd android
   ```

3. **Build the AAB file**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bundleRelease
   ```

4. **Find your AAB file**:
   Located at: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

5. **Upload to Google Play Console**:
   - Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
   - Select "Jits Journal"
   - Production ‚Üí Create new release
   - Upload `app-release.aab`
   - Add release notes (mention expandable classes, R2 storage, performance improvements)
   - Submit for review

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Your current signing config references `C:/Users/joe/my-release-key.jks`. Make sure this file exists on your Windows machine.

#### iOS Build (Requires Mac OR Use Codemagic)

**Since you don't have a Mac, use Option B (Codemagic) instead!**

If you did have a Mac, you would:
1. Pull latest code
2. Run `cd ios/App && pod install`
3. Open `ios/App/App.xcworkspace` in Xcode
4. Archive and upload to App Store Connect

---

### Option B: Cloud Builds with Codemagic (RECOMMENDED for iOS)

Codemagic allows you to build iOS apps **without a Mac**!

#### Setup Codemagic (One-time setup):

1. **Create account**: Go to [codemagic.io](https://codemagic.io)

2. **Connect your repository**: Link your GitHub/GitLab repo

3. **Add iOS signing certificates**:
   - Generate certificates in Apple Developer account
   - Upload to Codemagic (they have a wizard for this)

4. **Configure workflow**: Use the config in `CODEMAGIC_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

5. **Trigger builds**: 
   - Push to main branch OR
   - Manually trigger in Codemagic dashboard

#### What Codemagic Does:
- ‚úÖ Builds iOS app in the cloud (no Mac needed!)
- ‚úÖ Signs the app with your certificates
- ‚úÖ Can auto-upload to App Store Connect
- ‚úÖ Also supports Android builds if you prefer

**Cost**: Free tier available, paid plans from $40/month

---

### Option C: Use GitHub Actions (Alternative CI/CD)

You can also set up GitHub Actions to build Android apps automatically.

**Android with GitHub Actions**:
1. Store your keystore file as a GitHub Secret
2. Create workflow file (`.github/workflows/android.yml`)
3. Push to trigger builds

**iOS with GitHub Actions**:
Still requires Mac runners (GitHub charges for macOS runners)
