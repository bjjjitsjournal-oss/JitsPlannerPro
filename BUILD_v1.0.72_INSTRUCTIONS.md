```bash
npx cap sync android
```

```bash
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

### Step 4: Find Your AAB
The AAB file will be located at:
```
android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

### Step 5: Upload to Google Play Console
1. Go to: https://play.google.com/console
2. Select "Jits Journal" app
3. Go to **Production** ‚Üí **Create new release**
4. Upload `app-release.aab`
5. Add release notes:
   ```
   v1.0.72 - CRITICAL UPDATE
   ‚Ä¢ Fixed notes not saving/deleting on mobile devices
   ‚Ä¢ Fixed video upload error messages
   ‚Ä¢ 3-4x faster app loading and authentication
   ‚Ä¢ Notes page loads in 2-3 seconds (was 7 seconds)
   ‚Ä¢ Bug fixes and stability improvements
   ```
6. Click **Save** ‚Üí **Review release** ‚Üí **Start rollout to Production**

---

## üçé iOS BUILD (Using Codemagic - No Mac Needed!)

### Option A: Codemagic Cloud Build (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Push to GitHub** (triggers automatic build):
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "v1.0.72 - Critical mobile fixes + performance boost"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Monitor Build**:
   - Go to: https://codemagic.io
   - Select your project
   - Watch the build progress (~15-20 minutes)

3. **Download IPA**:
   - Once build completes, download the `.ipa` file
   - Codemagic can also auto-submit to App Store if configured

4. **Submit to App Store**:
   - Go to: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
   - Select "Jits Journal"
   - Go to **TestFlight** ‚Üí Upload the IPA
   - Add release notes:
     ```
     v1.0.72 - CRITICAL UPDATE
     ‚Ä¢ Fixed notes not saving/deleting on mobile devices
     ‚Ä¢ Fixed video upload error messages
     ‚Ä¢ 3-4x faster app loading and authentication
     ‚Ä¢ Notes page loads in 2-3 seconds (was 7 seconds)
     ‚Ä¢ Bug fixes and stability improvements
     ```
   - Submit for review

### Option B: Manual Build (Requires Mac)

If you have access to a Mac, follow these steps:

1. **Build Web App**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Sync to iOS**:
   ```bash
   npx cap sync ios
   ```

3. **Open in Xcode**:
   ```bash
   npx cap open ios
   ```

4. **In Xcode**:
   - Select your developer account under **Signing & Capabilities**
   - Select **Any iOS Device** as the build target
   - Go to **Product** ‚Üí **Archive**
   - Wait for archive to complete (~10-15 minutes)

5. **Upload to App Store**:
   - Click **Distribute App**
   - Choose **App Store Connect**
   - Click **Upload**
   - Add release notes in App Store Connect

## üîç POST-BUILD VERIFICATION

### Android Testing:
1. Install the AAB on a test device (use Google Play Console internal testing)
2. Test login/signup
3. **CRITICAL TEST**: Create a new note - should save without errors
4. **CRITICAL TEST**: Delete a note - should work without "refetchNotes" error
5. Test video uploads - should show proper error messages
6. Navigate to Notes page - should load in 2-3 seconds
7. Verify all features work correctly

### iOS Testing:
1. Install via TestFlight
2. Test login/signup
3. **CRITICAL TEST**: Create a new note - should save without errors
4. **CRITICAL TEST**: Delete a note - should work without errors
5. Test video uploads - should show proper error messages
6. Navigate to Notes page - should load in 2-3 seconds
7. Verify all features work correctly

## üìù IMPORTANT NOTES

### For Android:
- **Keystore Location**: `C:/Users/joe/my-release-key.jks`
- **Keystore Password**: `romeodog`
- **Key Alias**: `your_key_alias`
- Version Code MUST increment with each release (now at 72)

### For iOS:
- **Bundle ID**: `com.jitsjournal.app`
- **App ID**: Must match your Apple Developer account
- Version MUST match App Store Connect (now at 1.0.72)
- Export compliance: Encryption set to NO in Info.plist

### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails**: Run `npm run build` first
2. **Gradle errors**: Run `./gradlew clean` then try again
3. **Xcode signing issues**: Verify developer account is active
4. **Codemagic build fails**: Check CODEMAGIC_SETUP_GUIDE.md

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Build is successful when:
- ‚úÖ AAB/IPA builds without errors
- ‚úÖ Version shows as 1.0.72 in app stores
- ‚úÖ **Notes save/delete without "refetchNotes is not defined" error**
- ‚úÖ **Video uploads show proper error messages (not HTML)**
- ‚úÖ All features work correctly on mobile
- ‚úÖ Notes page loads in 2-3 seconds (major performance improvement!)
- ‚úÖ No console errors or crashes

## ‚ùì WHY DID THE BUILD BREAK (BUT VERCEL WORKED)?

**The Short Answer:**
Mobile app builds use **aggressive code optimization** that can strip out variables, while Vercel serves unoptimized development-like code.

**The Technical Explanation:**

### Vercel (Web):
- Serves the built files directly to browsers
- Uses **development-friendly** optimizations
- Preserves variable names and bindings
- Your code: `const { refetch: refetchNotes } = useQuery(...)` works fine
- Browser executes it exactly as written

### Mobile Build (Capacitor + Android/iOS):
- Bundles everything into a native app (APK/IPA)
- Uses **tree-shaking** to remove "unused" code
- Uses **name mangling** to minimize file size
- The bundler saw `refetch: refetchNotes` as an alias
- During optimization, it determined `refetchNotes` was "unused" (wrong!)
- It stripped out the binding, leaving callbacks calling an undefined variable
- Result: **ReferenceError: refetchNotes is not defined**

### The Fix:
Instead of:
```javascript
const { refetch: refetchNotes } = useQuery(...)
// Later: refetchNotes() - bundler loses this connection
```

We now use:
```javascript
const notesQuery = useQuery(...)
// Later: notesQuery.refetch() - stable object reference, can't be optimized away
```

This is a **common mobile build issue** - web builds are lenient, mobile builds are strict!
