# Cloudflare R2 Migration - Complete âœ…

## Overview
Successfully migrated video storage from Supabase Storage to Cloudflare R2 for improved scalability and cost efficiency.

## Why R2?
- **Zero egress fees**: Unlimited bandwidth at no extra cost
- **S3-compatible API**: Easy integration with existing tools
- **Lower storage costs**: ~$0.015/GB/month vs Supabase's $25/month for 8GB
- **Better scalability**: Pay only for what you use with no hard limits

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created
1. **server/r2Storage.ts**
   - `uploadToR2()`: Upload files to R2 bucket
   - `deleteFromR2()`: Remove files from R2
   - `getR2FileSize()`: Check file size
   - `getR2SignedUrl()`: Generate temporary access URLs
   - `r2FileExists()`: Check if file exists

### Modified Files
1. **server/routes.ts**
   - Updated video upload endpoint to use multipart form data with multer
   - Modified to upload directly to R2 instead of Supabase
   - Enhanced delete endpoint to handle both R2 and Supabase URLs (for backward compatibility)
   
2. **client/src/components/VideoUpload.tsx**
   - Changed from Supabase client-side upload to backend FormData upload
   - Removed Supabase import dependency
   - Streamlined upload flow for better user experience

3. **replit.md**
   - Documented R2 as the primary video storage solution

### Environment Variables Required
```
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key>
R2_ENDPOINT=<your-r2-endpoint>
R2_BUCKET_NAME=Jits Journal
```

## Migration Strategy
- **Zero downtime**: New videos upload to R2, existing videos remain accessible
- **Backward compatibility**: Delete endpoint handles both R2 and Supabase URLs
- **No data loss**: Legacy Supabase videos continue to work with automatic fallback
- **Graceful transition**: Users won't notice any difference

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Cost savings**: Dramatically reduced storage costs (from $25/mo fixed to ~$0.015/GB/mo variable)
2. **Unlimited egress**: Free bandwidth regardless of video views
3. **Better scalability**: No hard storage limits, pay-as-you-grow model
4. **Future-proof**: Easy to add CDN in front of R2 for global distribution

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Upload new video to note
- [ ] Verify video appears in R2 bucket
- [ ] Verify video plays correctly
- [ ] Delete new video
- [ ] Verify deletion from R2
- [ ] Test legacy Supabase video still plays
- [ ] Test deleting legacy Supabase video
- [ ] Verify storage quota updates correctly

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
1. Add Cloudflare CDN for faster global video delivery
2. Consider adding video transcoding pipeline
3. Implement automatic compression for large videos
4. Add video thumbnail generation on upload
5. Monitor R2 costs and usage patterns

## Rollback Plan (if needed)
If issues arise, revert these commits and:
1. Change `VideoUpload.tsx` back to Supabase client upload
2. Restore original upload endpoint in `routes.ts`
3. All existing videos remain functional (no data migration required)
