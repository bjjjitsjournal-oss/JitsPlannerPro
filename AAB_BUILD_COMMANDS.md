## üîß Important: Backend URL Configuration

Before building for mobile, ensure the app connects to your Render backend.

### Update capacitor.config.ts:

```typescript
import { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.jitsjournal.app',
  appName: 'Jits Journal',
  webDir: 'dist/public',
  server: {
    androidScheme: 'https',
    url: 'https://bjj-jits-journal.onrender.com' // Add this line
  },
  // ... rest of config
};

export default config;
```

**OR** set environment variable during build:

```powershell
$env:VITE_API_BASE_URL="https://bjj-jits-journal.onrender.com"
npm run build
npx cap sync android
```

---

## üì§ Upload to Google Play Console

1. Go to: https://play.google.com/console
2. Select "Jits Journal" app
3. Navigate to: **Production ‚Üí Create new release**
4. Upload the AAB file
5. Fill in release notes (e.g., "Bug fixes and performance improvements")
6. Click **Review release** ‚Üí **Start rollout to production**

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "eas: command not found"
```powershell
npm install -g eas-cli
```

### Error: "gradlew: command not found" (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Use this instead:
.\gradlew.bat bundleRelease
```

### Error: "ANDROID_HOME not set"
You need Android Studio installed. Use **Option 1 (EAS Build)** instead.

### Mobile app won't connect to backend
Make sure you:
1. Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` before building
2. OR updated `capacitor.config.ts` with Render URL
3. Rebuilt the app after making changes
