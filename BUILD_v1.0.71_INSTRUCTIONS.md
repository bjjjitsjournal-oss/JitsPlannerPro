## üîç POST-BUILD VERIFICATION

### Android Testing:
1. Install the AAB on a test device (use Google Play Console internal testing)
2. Test login/signup
3. Navigate to Notes page - should load in 2-3 seconds
4. Test video uploads
5. Verify all features work correctly

### iOS Testing:
1. Install via TestFlight
2. Test login/signup
3. Navigate to Notes page - should load in 2-3 seconds
4. Test video uploads
5. Verify all features work correctly

## üìù IMPORTANT NOTES

### For Android:
- **Keystore Location**: `C:/Users/joe/my-release-key.jks`
- **Keystore Password**: `romeodog`
- **Key Alias**: `your_key_alias`
- Version Code MUST increment with each release (now at 71)

### For iOS:
- **Bundle ID**: `com.jitsjournal.app`
- **App ID**: Must match your Apple Developer account
- Version MUST match App Store Connect (now at 1.0.71)
- Export compliance: Encryption set to NO in Info.plist

### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails**: Run `npm run build` first
2. **Gradle errors**: Run `./gradlew clean` then try again
3. **Xcode signing issues**: Verify developer account is active
4. **Codemagic build fails**: Check CODEMAGIC_SETUP_GUIDE.md
