# Database Performance - Migration Guide

## Current Setup
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL in `aws-1-ap-southeast-2` (Sydney, Australia)
- **Backend:** Render.com (region TBD - check your Render dashboard)
- **Issue:** ~1.5 second network latency per database query

## Solution 1: Prefetching (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
**What we did:** Notes and Social data now load in the background as soon as you log in.

**Result:**
- First click on Notes/Social: **Instant!** (data already loaded)
- No code changes or migrations needed
- Works immediately

**Limitation:** Initial login still takes time to prefetch data

---

## Solution 2: Move Backend Closer to Database (EASY)

### Option A: Change Render Region to Sydney
**Difficulty:** ⭐ Easy (2 minutes)  
**Cost:** Free

**Steps:**
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Check your current server region
3. If it's NOT in Sydney:
   - Create a new Web Service in the **Singapore** region (closest to Sydney)
   - Redeploy your backend code there
   - Update your frontend API URL
4. **Result:** Latency drops from 1.5s to ~50-100ms ✅

## Solution 3: Move Database Closer to Backend (HARDER)

### Check Your Render Region First
```bash
# In Render dashboard, look for your web service region
# Common regions: Oregon (US West), Frankfurt (EU), Singapore (Asia)
```

### If Your Backend is in US/EU:

#### Option A: Create Supabase Project in Same Region
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐ Medium (30 minutes)  
**Cost:** Free tier available

**Steps:**
1. Create new Supabase project in Oregon or Frankfurt (match your Render region)
2. Export data from current database:
   ```bash
   pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup.sql
   ```
3. Import to new database:
   ```bash
   psql $NEW_DATABASE_URL < backup.sql
   ```
4. Update `DATABASE_URL` in Render dashboard
5. Test and verify

**Pros:**
- Same Supabase features
- Row-level security, real-time, etc.

**Cons:**
- Need to migrate data
- New database URL

---

#### Option B: Switch to Render PostgreSQL
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐ Advanced (1 hour)  
**Cost:** $7/month minimum

**Steps:**
1. Create PostgreSQL instance in Render (same region as backend)
2. Export and import data (same as above)
3. Remove Supabase-specific features (RLS, triggers)
4. Update connection code

**Pros:**
- Database and backend in same data center
- Fastest possible performance (<10ms latency)

**Cons:**
- Monthly cost
- Lose Supabase Auth/Storage features
- More manual database management

## Recommended Approach

### Quick Win (Do This Now): ✅ DONE
Prefetching is already implemented. Login once and Notes/Social will be instant!

### Best Long-Term Solution:
1. **Check your Render region** in dashboard
2. **If in US/EU:** Create new Supabase project in same region and migrate
3. **If in Asia:** You're already optimized! The 1.5s is unavoidable with current infrastructure

### Expected Performance After Migration:
- **Current:** 2-4 seconds first load, 800ms subsequent
- **After region match:** 200-400ms all loads ⚡
- **With prefetch:** Instant when switching tabs ✨
